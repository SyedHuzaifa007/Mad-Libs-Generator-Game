# Mad-Libs-Generator-Game
### **This is the basic python project for absolute begginers.**
The project is about the basic use of python and GUI App making in tkinter. All I have did is I created a simple GUI that runs a script when a button is clicked.
I have wrote some functions that takes several inputs from the user and creates an interesting story when the inputs are combined together.
- The app is consisted of 3 buttons first for 'Story-1'.
- Second for 'Story-2'. 
- Third for 'Story-3'.
- On each click a script is run that takes inputs.
- The script collect all the inputs and join together to create an intersting story.
#### **I hope you enjoy creating the stories.**
